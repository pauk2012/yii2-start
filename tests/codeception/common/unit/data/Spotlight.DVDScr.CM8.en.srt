<i>Based on Actual Events</i>

2
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,756
<i>Boston, MA - 1976</i>

3
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:00,843
- How's that going?

4
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,094
- Mother's ballin' and
the uncle is pissed off.

5
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:04,655
She's not married?

6
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,858
Divorced, with 4 kids.

7
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,203
I guess the Father
was helping out.

8
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,787
Helping out?

9
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,755
- Hey, Mr. Burke, they're in
the back talking to the Bishop.

10
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,048
And Father?

11
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,360
We put him in the break room.

12
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:19,922
- Any press?

13
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,467
Some guy from the Citizen
but we sent him away.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,569
None of the big papers.

15
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,222
Let's keep it that way.

16
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:27,091
Who's that?

17
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:28,803
Assistant D.A.

18
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,594
It's gonna be hard to keep
the papers from arraignment.

19
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,444
What arraignment?
